        <h1>What are Computer ProgrammingLanguages?</h1>

        <br>

        <body>Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages. These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors. There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today. We've compiled overviews of the 12 most important, relevant and in-demand of these languages below.</body>

        <br>

        <h2>Python</h2>
        
        <br>
   
        <body>Python is an advanced programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented and built on flexible and robust semantics.</body>

        <br>

        <h3>Java</h3>

        <br>

        <body> Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language with several features that make it ideal for web-based development.</body>

        <br>

        <h4>Ruby/Ruby on Rails</h4>

        <br>

        <body> Ruby is an open-sourced, object-oriented scripting language that can be used independently or as part of the Ruby on Rails web framework.</body>

        <br>

        <h5>HTML (HyperText MarkupLanguage) </h5>

        <br>

        <body>HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages; it ensures proper formatting of text and images (using tags) so that Internet browsers can display them in the ways they were intended to look. </body>

        <br>

        <h6>JavaScript </h6>

        <br>

        <body>JavaScript is a client-side programming language that runs inside a client browser and processes commands on a computer rather than a server. It is commonly placed into an HTML or ASP file. Despite its name, JavaScript is not related to Java. </body>

        <br>

        <h7>C Language </h7>

        <br>

        <body>C Language is a structure-oriented, middle-level programming language mostly used to develop low-level applications. </body>

        <br>

        <h8>C++ </h8>

        <br>

        <body>C++ is a general purpose, object-oriented, middle-level programming language and is an extension of C language, which makes it possible to code C++ in a "C style". In some situations, coding can be done in either format, making C++ an example of a hybrid language</body>
